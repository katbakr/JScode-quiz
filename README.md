## Description
This is a quiz to allow users to test their knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts. This quiz is timed and score/time is adjusted as users answer questions correctly and incorrectly. At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to save their score with their initials for others to see. Creating this quiz has helped me to better understand how to use event listeners, local storage, and utilizing JavaScript to easily navigate and manipulate the DOM.
